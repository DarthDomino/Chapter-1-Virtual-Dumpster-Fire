With the recent boom of OnlyFans, a lot of people who were not sex workers before are starting to dabble. 

To really get a grasp of the industry, lifestyle and mindset I highly recommend reading the book: Ho Tactics, by G.L. Lambert

He has a blog and other books that everyone should read. 

Without giving away too many of my secrets, I wanted to compile together some things that everyone (creators and buyers alike) should be aware of. 

If you have not read my previous post, there is a lot more technical information there on how to harden your devices and avoid online stalkers:

Settings: 

Turn off ‚ÄúSearchable by Phone Number and Email‚Äù

Get multiple Instagrams, one for OnlyFans and a Friends Only ‚ÄúFinsta‚Äù  

Make them both private, you will get reported less anyway.

Don‚Äôt post ANY of the photos you post to your OnlyFans Instagram on any private profile, such as Facebook because a simple reverse Google image search 
will make your real information easy to find. 

For OnlyFans settings, display your location half a world away from you or do not display it. 

Reports:
 
We‚Äôre not exactly sure what gets you banned on Instagram but snap codes in a photo, too much butt cheek (not exactly sure what‚Äôs ‚Äútoo much‚Äù), hand bras, 
and censors over nude photos are all ban-worthy. You can show nipple as long as it's covered by something (even if it's sheer) at your own risk.

SnapChat bans happen too frequently to even get into, and TBH I don‚Äôt want to give away those secrets. Sorry not sorry üòÇ make a bunch of back ups, 
make a linktree and hope for the best, boo. 

(Clue: When everything works properly, your phone runs on time). 

Also, banned Instagrams ARE recoverable, but it's going to cost you some coin $ and be wary that lots of people say they can but they can't and will 
keep your money, so finding a trusted source is important. 

The Dark Part‚Ä¶. 

Any seasoned Snap Girl has been sent something (for lack of better term because there is no term that could possibly encapsulate it) horrific, 
brain scarring and obscene. With OnlyFans and less DMs being opened on SnapChat it is less of an issue, these days. 

If this does happen to you, there is a system the community has created in order to collect this evidence and send it to the correct department in law enforcement. 

If someone sends you child pornography, do NOT *I REPEAT* DO NOT screenshot it, because now YOU are in possession of child pornography. 

Instead, get them talking about what they‚Äôre planning and find their INTENT. The words are the most important part. 
Screenshot them saying they want to hurt kids, plan on hurting kids, or what they would do to kids. 

I know this is absolutely terrible, but it‚Äôs happened to many of us and back then we had nowhere to send it and no system in place. 

Once you have the screenshots of their WORDS ONLY, and a clear view of their SnapChat username, I have a law enforcement intake email you can send it to. 
Reach out to me personally for it. (It took me two years to get it, I'm not just going to give that shit out). 

However there is also an amazing foundation run by God himself: Chris Hadnagy

It‚Äôs best to take screenshots all at once because once they are notified you‚Äôre screenshotting, they will block you. 

Closing: 

If you're really hardcore, use Exif (there's even an app now) to delete all metadeta from videos and photos. 

If you get emails notifying you to verify your account, DO NOT IGNORE IT.

Make sure you have secondary authentication, through email or my personal favorite: the Authy App but NEVER your phone number. 

I also recommend the LastPass App for creating and storing secure passwords. 

OnlyFans helps tremendously when it comes to security. Payment apps if not secured properly can be (without exaggeration) life-ruining, 
so only take payments directly through OnlyFans. 

If someone is adamant about only paying through apps, ignore them it's not worth it.  

None of the proper settings are set by default and this has caused tremendous damage in people‚Äôs lives. 
In fact I'm so salty about it....
